I'm two weeks away from being an official Tech Talent South Full Stack Web Developer Alumni! Wohoo!!

That means that I am starting to look for a job! Which also means I need a portfolio. So Izzie Fitzzie has officially been moved from Wordpress to Jekyll! That's right- I built this bad boy from pretty much stratch!

On a fitness note- we are 46 days away from my wedding and 12 days away from dress fitting! I decided last week to kick it up a notch and go full hiit cardio. The plan for the remaining wedding countdown is:

-Complete Ashley Conrad's Clutch Cut 3 Week Program! This is a free program on bodybuilding.com that is an absolute killer! I will admit I felt like I might pass out when I followed her nutrition macro set-up so I added some carbs in there but I am still feeling super cut right now and I'm only 1 week in! She  focuses on alternating HIIT cardio and fast paced full body circuits.

-After the 3 weeks end on September 18th I will be doing my previous lifting program for the remainder of the month- more on that when we get closer.

-Clutch Cut AGAIN from October 1st- 22nd. Then get married and eat SO MUCH FOOD on the honeymoon in Belize!!!
